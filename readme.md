# Google Keep Clone using Javascript

A google keep clone developed using html,css and vanilla JS.

In this projects, we perform operations such as adding a note, editing the note and deleting the note.

We also use local storage to save the state of our notes and update accordingly.

This project is a good head-start for understanding Javascript and DOM elements.
